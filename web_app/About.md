**Motivation:**  
Marketing conversion prediction adds tremendous value to any marketing campaign. By leveraging data and predictive analytics, marketers are able to anticipate and measure the likelihood of a customer or user completing a desired action. This gives marketers the opportunity to strategically target the most valuable customers and maximize their ROI. 

**Goal:**  
The goal of this project is to create a conversion prediction model that leverages data and predictive analytics to help marketers maximize their ROI. The project is split into two parts. The first part is the proof of concept, which includes exploratory data analysis, model training and validation. The second part includes the development and deployment of the web app. The customer conversion model allows marketers to anticipate and measure the likelihood of a customer or user completing a desired action. By utilizing this model, marketers can strategically target the most valuable customers and optimize their campaigns for maximum success.

**Challenge:**  
This project was a complex undertaking that involved several different challenges. From data cleaning and data preparation to data modeling and building a web app, this project required an end-to-end pipeline. Additionally, the project required deploying the web app in a Docker container, which can be hosted on a local server and/or in a cloud environment like AWS, Azure or GCP. As such, this project presented a unique challenge in terms of creating a comprehensive, unified workflow that was both efficient and effective.
